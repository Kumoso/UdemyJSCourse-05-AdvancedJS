// Functions Returning Functions

/* A function can return another function. That's all this demonstrates. It's not a fantastic example ^__^
Functions in JS are 'First Class Functions'. This means that they are, and can be used like, any other objects in JS.
This allows a lot of flexibility in how they're used.

/*It's really a very strange example, because you could just store the individual functions as teacherQuestion, designerQuestion etc.
and it would be dryer and more readable!
But it demonstrates the concept. We'll use it in more practical ways later :3
